## Part 1: Theoretical Understanding
Includes short-answer responses and comparative analysis:

Differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Jupyter Notebook use cases in AI.

How spaCy enhances NLP over basic Python.

Comparison: Scikit-learn vs TensorFlow on:

Target applications

Ease of use

Community support

## Part 2: Practical Implementation

## Task 1: Classical ML (Scikit-learn)

Dataset: Iris

Model: Decision Tree Classifier

Preprocessing:

Handling missing values

Label encoding (if needed)

Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall


## Task 2: Deep Learning (TensorFlow or PyTorch)
Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digits

Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Target Accuracy: >95%

Output:

Model architecture

Training/Evaluation metrics

Prediction visualizations (5 samples)

## Task 3: NLP with spaCy
Input: Amazon Product Reviews (sample)

Tasks:

Named Entity Recognition (NER) for product names and brands

Rule-based sentiment analysis (positive/negative)

## Part 3: Ethics & Optimization

# Ethical Considerations

Bias in datasets (e.g., digit style or review language)

Tools for mitigation:

TensorFlow Fairness Indicators

Custom rule-based filters in spaCy

## Debugging Challenge

Includes a buggy TensorFlow script (e.g., shape mismatch, wrong loss)

Debugged version with clear comments


## Bonus Task: Deployment (Optional)

Streamlit Web App for MNIST Classifier
Upload an image of a handwritten digit

Predict and display the result in real-time

Lightweight and easy to use
